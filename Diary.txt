Added this diary file to record intentions and changes during updates.
New version of the previously updated accounting system.
Main differences of the new system:
- Almost everything was rewritten.
- Nearly a completely new data structure and management, now focused on JSON files and a specific main entity.
- Better use of Pythonâ€™s classes and logic.
- Optimized memory usage throughout runs.

Somethings weren't tested yet, but I think everything should be working.
At least installing, accounts manipulation, entries manipulation and Trial Balance generation is workning well.

Intentions for the next update:
- Work on the invoices module:
  > Register products and services commercialized by the user and generate commercial invoices.
  > Manage product stock by recording received and sold invoices.
  > Define individual parameters for each product.
  > Generate stock reports.
  > Integrate the invoices module with accounting entries.
- Work with cost centers to generate reports by cost center.
